CVE-2024-6387 affects OpenSSH versions from 8.5p1 to 9.7p1 and is a regression of an old flaw, CVE-2006-5051. An unauthenticated attacker can gain root access on glibc-based Linux systems, but they need to trigger a race condition and win the race. Researchers who discovered and responsibly disclosed the vulnerability say it typically takes ten thousand attempts — under default OpenSSH settings, the attack takes 6-8 hours. According to Censys and Shodan, around 14 million potentially vulnerable hosts are accessible on the Internet.

To prevent the vulnerability, named regreSSHion, from haunting you like Log4shell, it is recommended to update OpenSSH and restrict access to devices running the OpenSSH service using network access control tools. Remember, this includes not only servers but also many IoT devices.
